- 2026-01-26: fix GH Pages base-path (Vite base ./ on build; index.html favicon uses %BASE_URL%). Added pnpm vibe:doctor check. Status: done.
- 2026-01-26: fix assist-server command loop (route executeResult back to requester; avoid double connection handler). Make assist client origin-aware (wss + hostname + VITE_ASSIST_URL override). Updated vibe:doctor checks. Status: done.
- 2026-01-26: make pnpm dev the default full dev experience; add pnpm check (doctor+lint+build). Status: done.
- 2026-01-26: apply initial theme on startup (store applies initialState.theme immediately). Extended vibe:doctor to verify. Status: done.

- 2026-01-26: add GitHub Actions deploy workflow for GitHub Pages; update github skill doc; verified with pnpm check. Status: done.

- 2026-01-26: strengthen verification loop: vibe:doctor now asserts package.json scripts (vibe:doctor exists; pnpm check includes doctor+lint+test+build). Ran pnpm check. Status: done.
